# Platform Loopback

### Models
	* After you create a new model.json and model.js file remember to update model-config.json
	* The name in the model-config.json file needs to be identical to the name in the model.json file

### Endpoints
	* If you create a new remote method using Model.remoteMethod remember to update component-config.json `loopback-component-jsonapi` with the name of the remote method
